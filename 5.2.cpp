/*
Write a program that asks the users gender and age. Finally the program prints a sentence based on the following rule:
* Male 0-55 years: "You are a man in his prime!"
* Male 56-100 years: "You are a wise man!"
* Female 0-55 years: "You are like a blooming flower!"
* Female 56-100 years: "You look young for your age!"
* Else "Error encountered!"
Age is handled as an integer variable and gender as string variable (m/f). Letter case is ignored.
